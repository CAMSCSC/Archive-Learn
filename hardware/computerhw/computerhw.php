Can run you from $75 to $250</figcaption>	</figure>	<p>The motherboard (mobo) is filled with ports that all of the other parts connect to. The motherboard has a chipset which regulates the information between parts. The motherboard contains:</p>	<ul>		<li>DIMM Slots for RAM - Has either 2 or 4 for dual channel support</li>		<li>CPU Socket - Drop the CPU in and secure it with a little lever</li>		<li>PCI Slots - Slots that are widely used for extra addons such as graphics cards or extra USB 3.0 slots or WiFI adapters</li>		<li>ATX Power Connector - A socket for power from the PSU to power the motherboard</li>		<li>"Output Row" - Slew of female adapters that range from DVI, VGA, HDMI, USB, Ethernet, Audio Out/In, or PS/2 connectors</li>		<li>SATA Slots - Used to connect HDDs and SSDs</li>	</ul>		<h3>The Processor</h3>	<figure>		<img src="proc.png" />		<figcaption>Fig. 2 The Processor - filled with prongs. Can run you from $50 to $1000</figcaption>	</figure>	<p>The central processing unit (CPU) is what computes the 0s and 1s. The clock is the speed in usually GHz or MHz. Most high-end modern PC processors are quad-core.</p>	<h3>RAM</h3>	<figure>		<img src="ram.png" />		<figcaption>Fig. 3 The Random Access Memory - Costs range from $10 to $2250</figcaption>	</figure>	<p>RAM is used to quickly store data that is used by a running program. RAM comes in 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, 16GB and is clocked from 776 MHz to 2400 MHz.</p>	<h3>Hard disc drive / Solid state drive</h3>	<figure>		<img src="ssd.png" />		<figcaption>Fig. 4 HHD on right SSD on left - Costs range from $50 to $1500</figcaption>	</figure>	<p>HDD/SSD is used to store data on the long term. HDDs use discs to read and write data while SSDs used NAND chips. SSDs have very fast read/write times, but they are more expensive.</p>	<h3>Power Supply Unit</h3>	<figure>		<img src="psw.png" />		<figcaption>Fig. 5 The PSU - Costs range from $150 to $500</figcaption>	</figure>	<p>The PSU simply regulates and splits power for the computer.</p>	<h3>Case</h3>	<figure>		<img src="case.png" />		<figcaption>Fig. 6 The Case - Costs range from $60 to $300</figcaption>	</figure>	<p>The Case gives a home to the computer parts.</p>	<h3>Graphics Card</h3>	<figure>		<img src="gfx.png" />		<figcaption>Fig. 7 The Graphics Card - Costs range from $60 to $3000. Easily the most expensive part</figcaption>	</figure>	<p>The graphics card is used to render the screen. It is also used to play jaw dropping games.</p>	<script src="../../scripts/prism.js"></script><?php include('../../footer.php')?></body></html>
