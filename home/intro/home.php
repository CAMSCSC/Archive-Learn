		<h3>The Basics</h3>
		<p>Lessons look somewhat like this. Learn has been tested on the latest desktop versions of Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari as well as the latest mobile versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. It is recommended that you update your browser to the latest version before using Learn. In addition, consider getting one of the listed browsers if you are not using one of them right now. Sometimes, the server may experience a high number of requests. If you have clicked on a tab or lesson and nothing shows up, please wait a few seconds. There is no need to click multiple times as the data will show up when loaded.</p>
		
		<h3>Features</h3>
		<p>All lessons are integrated into the home page. You can select a category by clicking on it in the left hand corner. At any time, you can hide the side bar by pressing Ctrl+z. Alternatively, you can toggle the side bar by clicking on the footer of any lesson page (helpful if you are using mobile).</p>
